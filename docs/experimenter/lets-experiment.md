## Let’s Experiment

On the next page you will find a list of ten experimenter activities that will challenge you to think about the ways in which you have been designing and delivering your course content, as well as the formats, tools, and approaches you have been using. For this module you are asked to complete only **3 out of the 10** possible experimenter activities.

*   If you have finished any of the other Extend modules, think back to your work on them!
*   Do you remember being struck with the desire to “experiment” further as you progressed through the different extend activities?
*   Have you been asking yourself whether or not you need to update your approaches to teaching and learning and how you might do this?
*   Have you considered how your current pedagogical practices might have limited access for some students?
*   Are you worried about introducing a new technology tool and how that might integrate with an existing one you are already using?
*   Are you worried that not all students might have access to those tools?

This module encourages you reflect on those curious questions, start experimenting with different tools, modes and approaches to figure them out, and bask in the eventual glory of the aha educational enlightened moments coming your way.

Finally, before you start experimenting you should explore the eCampusOntario [Extend Toolkit](https://toolkit.ecampusontario.ca/) that includes information on all tools used in Ontario Extend as well as other ones recommended to complete module activities. Other collections are listed below, offering dozens of technology tools with explanations of how and why they might be used in course design, class activities, assessments and so on. The tools found in these additional collections will lend added context for completing the experimenter activities found in this module. If you want to determine if a technology tool is the best choice for you and your learner’s needs, you might want to evaluate it using the [Rubric for E-Learning Tool Evaluation](https://teaching.uwo.ca/pdf/elearning/Rubric-for-eLearning-Tool-Evaluation.pdf).
