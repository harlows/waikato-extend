# Metacognition

Students need to assess the demands of the task, evaluate their own knowledge and skills, plan their progress, monitor their progress, and adjust their strategies as needed.

Self-directed learning and actively taking the time to reflect on one’s own learning is described as **metacognition.** Developing metacognitive skills through deliberate practice and embedded checkpoints fosters intellectual habits that are valuable for learning retention and across disciplines.

These checkpoints should occur at the beginning of the learning where students are encouraged to practice task assessment and planning. Metacognition should continue through the evaluation of the outcomes and adjust approaches accordingly.

A very important factor for developing this flexible mindset is rooted in students’ self-efficacy. It is extremely useful for instructors to stress the importance of developmental approaches so that they can fully appreciate that intelligence is not fixed.

## Strategies to promote metacognition

*   Be explicit; indicate what you do not want; provide performance criteria.
*   Provide opportunities to peer and self-assess; practice; and give feedback.
*   Ask your students whether the answer they provide is reasonable given the problem.

Here are some helpful prompts to ask your learners:

*   What do I already know about this topic?
*   How does this topic make me feel?
*   Does this topic relate to something I already know?
*   How can I apply this topic in another context?

One activity that can be done at the end of class is [Stephen Brookfield’s critical incident questionnaire (CIQ).](http://www.stephenbrookfield.com/critical-incident-questionnaire)

Other metacognitive strategies that lead to self-directed learners are [Note-taking](https://www.flickr.com/photos/gforsythe/5735684602/) ([see Organise Knowledge](organise-knowledge.md)), One Minute Paper ([see Feedback and Practice](feedback-and-practice.md)), Reflective Writing (nuggets), Exam Wrappers, and Retrospective Post-Assessment.
