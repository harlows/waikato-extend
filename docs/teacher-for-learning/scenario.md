### Scenario

Students don’t seem to understand the material in my course. They just don’t get it! For some reason they seem to miss the mark in my exams each year no matter what I try to do to prepare them. They seem disinterested and distracted. I want them to understand the relevance and enthusiasm I feel for my content, but I’m out of ideas on how to get through to them.
