# Climate of the Course

The social, emotional, and intellectual climate of the course and the classroom has an impact on learning. You can promote a positive climate in your classroom by:

*   Providing opportunities for small group learning and interaction.
*   Creating a classroom charter.
*   Listening carefully.
*   Offering opportunities to be heard.
*   Consider intersectional experiences.
*   Providing an environment that makes uncertainty safe.
*   Examining your assumptions.
*   Being respectful and inclusive: incorporate diverse experiences and contexts.
*   Considering cognitive, psychomotor, and affective domains.
*   Being an authentic and genuine teacher.
*   Co-designing learning goals and classroom expectations.

These factors that promote a healthy classroom climate will vary depending on the people involved. It is always best to establish ground rules for your class right from the outset so that the classroom climate standards are co-constructed and meaningful to the group as a whole.

## What does a positive classroom climate look like online?

As you will see in other modules, the [Community of Inquiry](https://coi.athabascau.ca/coi-model/) is a helpful framework. Beyond just the presentation of content, described as the “cognitive presence,” it is also important to balance and consider social and teaching presences.

## Extend Connections

Be aware that some ideas of a positive classroom space can come at the expense of marginalized students. When trying to create a learning environment that is productive and inclusive for all students, consider the multiplicity of experiences students might be coming from.

Some great resources that might help you think about this are:
