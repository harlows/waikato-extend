# How Learning Works <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

This module is based primarily on the excellent book by Susan Ambrose and colleagues, [**How Learning Works: Seven Research-Based Principles for Smart Teaching**](https://waikato.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/64WAIKATO_INST/10hutka/alma9917428498803401) (2010).

> _“Learning results from what the student **does and thinks** and only from what the student **does and thinks**. The teacher can **advance learning** only by influencing what the **student does to learn**.”_
> 
> – Herbert A Simon

The seven principles are:

1. Students’ **prior knowledge** can help or hinder learning.
2. How students **organise knowledge** influences how they learn and apply what they know.
3. Students’ **motivation** determines, directs, and sustains what they do to learn.
4. To develop **mastery,** students must acquire component skills, practice integrating them, and know when to apply what they have learned.
5. Goal-directed **practice** coupled with targeted **feedback** enhances the quality of students’ learning.
6. Students’ current level of **development** interacts with the social, emotional, and intellectual **climate** of the course to impact learning.
7. To become **self-directed learners,** students must learn to monitor and adjust their approaches to learning.
