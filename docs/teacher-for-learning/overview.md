### Overview

Why else do we teach but for learning? Yet, there is often a disconnect between conventional, accepted teaching practices and research evidence about what enables learning. In this module, we will explore how we learn and what we can do to ensure learning environments are effective, accessible, intersectional, and equitable. As we extend our knowledge, we will consider strategies for designing significant learning experiences that are grounded in and informed by research principles that foster student learning in specific contexts.

#### Extend Connections

[**Effective**](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/effective)**:** producing a decided, decisive, or desired effect.

[**Intersectionality**](https://www.ywboston.org/2017/03/what-is-intersectionality-and-what-does-it-have-to-do-with-me/)**:** The interconnected nature of social categorizations such as race, class, and gender, regarded as creating overlapping and interdependent systems of discrimination or disadvantage. Coined by Crenshaw (1989), it takes into account people’s overlapping identities and experiences in order to understand the complexity of prejudices they face.

[**Equity**](https://www.broward.org/Climate/Documents/EquityHandout_082019.pdf)**:** Just and fair inclusion. The goals of equity must be to create conditions that allow all to reach their full potential. Equity is less concerned with the optics of making things look “equal”, rather it addresses structural imbalances that keep all from fair experiences.

[**Accessibility**](https://accessiblecampus.ca/understanding-accessibility/)**:** is a general term used to describe the degree to which a product, device, service, or environment is available to be used by all intended audiences.

#### Outcome

Design effective learning activities and experiences that are grounded in research-based principles of learning that promote students using their knowledge in meaningful ways.

#### Objectives

*   Reflect on core beliefs about teaching and learning and the ways they impact teaching practices and learning outcomes.
*   Examine [teaching approaches and strategies](https://www.cmu.edu/teaching/principles/teaching.html) that foster student learning in specific contexts.
*   Identify considerations when designing significant learning experiences grounded in and informed by research-based principles.
