![](images/digLit.jpg)

[Digital literacies](https://dmlcentral.net/wp-content/uploads/files/doug-belshaw-edd-thesis-final.pdf) are complex and nuanced, and there are myriad of ones to consider. Using technology tools effectively to address specific learning challenges is just one aspect of digital literacies for teaching. These literacies encompass the abilities to locate, use, summarize, evaluate, create, and communicate information while using digital technologies and web-based platforms. They also include the expertise to engage safely, responsibly and ethically in online communities and networks.

Explore some of the definitions of digital literacy that are linked below:

As you are reading the definitions, take note of ideas or competencies that resonate with your sense of what digital literacy is so that you can come up with your own definition.

Developing digital literacies is an ongoing process. These modules are a starting point; they include resources and a set of challenges and activities, that are part of a never-ending process as we extend our digital literacies for teaching.

As an educator, it is important to keep in mind that there are barriers to teaching and learning and not all students have the same tools. A discussion of how to be aware of those [barriers to digital literacy](https://bccampus.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Barriers-Digital-Literacy.pdf) and how to remove them as much as possible can be found in BCcampusâ€™ study Removing Barriers to Online Learning Through a Teaching and Learning Lens.
