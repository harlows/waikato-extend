## Design

Now that you have mapped out a plan, how do you actually want to prototype? We suggest one of two ways:

1.  Dig into the Tool
2.  Use Creative Materials

### 1. Dig into the Tool

If you decide to take the leap and start working with the tool, keep in mind that this requires dedicated time. If it is your first time using the tool, go through any tutorials provided, or search for some online – undoubtedly there are others that you can learn from. Also reassure yourself that this prototype does not need to solve the learner challenge entirely – perhaps it is just one aspect of the challenge that you have uncovered. Start small. That is the whole idea behind prototyping – you create what is known as the “minimal viable product”.

### 2. Prototype with Post-it notes

You can always take a cautionary, but equally valuable approach by mocking up your prototype using post-it notes. Post-it notes can help you storyboard and prioritize the sequence of interactions that support the use of your technology. You can add steps in and move them around, and ultimately end up with a series of instructions that can help frame the activity for your learner.

**Visit the Extend Community to share your prototype with your peers or learners to receive feedback.**

>Share a picture of your post-it note prototype with peers or learners to obtain feedback. Think about providing feedback to your peers on their prototypes with regards to the following:
>
> - What worked?
> - What did not work?
> - What questions do you have?
> - Could learners experience any barriers in using this prototype?
> - If so, how could they be overcome?
> - Do you have any ideas for them to consider?
