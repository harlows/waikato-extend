## Design-Thinking Approach

To get you started, we are going to use the process of [design thinking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_thinking). Design thinking taps into a designer’s toolkit to engage users in creating and experimenting to spark new ideas and then use feedback to improve those ideas. The core principle of design thinking is that it is human-centered –the people who will benefit from the product or solution are directly involved in its design.

In educational contexts, using the design-thinking approach can be helpful because it focuses on involving learners in finding a solution to a known problem or challenge, in a collaborative and iterative way.

There are various [methodologies and approaches](http://www.uxbeginner.com/ux-beginner-guide-understand-design-thinking-approaches/) to design-thinking. In this module, we will follow the path of:

*   Empathize
*   Define
*   Ideate

*   Prototype
*   Connect
*   Test
