## Summary

Recipients of the Waikato Extend Scholar badge will have examined how they can use their classroom and courses as a research lab to explore how they might improve their teaching practice and positively affect student outcomes and their satisfaction with the overall learning experience in their course. They have considered research about teaching and learning within their discipline and reflected on a process to implement a research plan.
