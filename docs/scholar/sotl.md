## The Scholarship of Teaching and Learning (SoTL)

To learn more about SoTL, watch the video **The Key Characteristics of the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning (Center for Engaged Learning (CELatElon), September 2013)** (below).

This video features several educators defining SoTL in the context of their own professional practice.

Everybody involved in teaching has questions about the success of their practice. We deal with some of the questions informally all the time. In other cases, we seek to formalise our enquiry by doing research, and that is what SoTL is about. The purpose of SoTL is to improve learning by implementing optimised teaching practices based on research and evidence to support changes in practice.

Brock University has also recently created a series of engaging animated YouTube SoTL videos found here in this [Extend Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOG-INM6Lv0ImlMGdLY3h7bq5T1m5PmGg) . Each video is short - typically around 2 minutes in length.
