## Considerations for your SoTL Project

As an experienced educator you have already done some research in this area and published it, or you might be thinking of doing some research. But now you need to consider how to conduct research for your context.

Watch the video **Examples of SoTL Projects** (below) which provides examples from three instructors who describe their research projects, the questions they were seeking to answer, and how they benefited from the experience.

The video participants describe their large and small-scale questions, and research projects that were very specific to their disciplines and their interests. You may wish to start small with your own research.

Like any research project, a SoTL project requires you to formalize your research approach. Remember, what is different about SoTL is that the focus is on improving learning outcomes as a result of practices you implement, research, assess, and report.

Typical considerations include:

Your own research experience may predispose you to follow a deductive or quantitative approach to test a current approach to the problem. Alternatively, you may wish to take a more exploratory, inductive approach using qualitative methods to illuminate new thinking about a teaching/learning problem. It is really up to you what approach you take.

### What kinds of problems about teaching practice interest you?

There are some well-known areas of practice that SoTL researchers have probed through classroom projects. Examples from SoTL projects are made available to educators to explore through the University of British Columbia resources:

### Extend Activity #3
#### Outline your SoTL Plan
> Now we move into the phase where you will outline a research plan for an SoTL project in your area of interest.
>
> In this activity you will be doing your work in a document that **will be used for the remaining activities in this module**, and eventually shared in a [SoTL Research Plan Folder](http://bit.ly/sotl-folder) with the ones done by previous participants.
>
> Visit the [Outline Your SoTL Plan](https://elearn.waikato.ac.nz/mod/forum/view.php?id=1649877) activity in the Activity Bank for full instructions and submission link.
