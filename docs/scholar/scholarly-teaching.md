The [Scholarly Teacher](https://www.scholarlyteacher.com/about) applies evidence-based practice to enrich student learning.

When teaching and learning are grounded in the scholarship of teaching and learning we treat our classrooms and programs as a source of interesting questions about learning; find ways to explore and shed light on these questions; use this evidence to design and refine new activities, assignments, and assessments; and share what we have found with colleagues who can comment, critique and build on new insights (Huber and Hutchings, 2005).

> Important to this process is considering what existing empirical work is exclusionary, one dimensional, and dated before building your pedagogy upon it. Consider researching pedagogical practices, attaining resources, and collecting empirical date that are decolonial, intersectional, inclusive, and diverse.

Scholarly teaching is, at its core, an approach to teaching that is informed by inquiry and evidence (both one’s own, and that of others) about student learning. It focuses on examining the ways in which we construct the learning environments that we offer students, the attention we pay to students and their learning. In the book, Making Teaching and Learning Visible (Bernstein, Burnett, Goodburn and Savory, 2006), the authors make the point that, “An excellent teacher is one who is engaged in a well-prepared and intentional ongoing investigation of the best ways to promote a deep understanding on the part of as many students as possible.” (2006, p. 215)

And, that, is what Scholarly Teaching is all about. It is about seeking evidence that what we are doing is getting at the heart of learning and it is about sharing what we know and the evidence that we have with our colleagues.
