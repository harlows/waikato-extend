## Empower: Map your PLN

Earlier you reflected on the informal PLNs that surround you, and indeed, these networks are meant to be informal. But as you explore PLNs in greater depth, you will want to think about how you can use digital technologies to build and develop your network to breathe new life into your professional growth and better support your teaching. You can do this by mapping your own PLN.

The Mapping Your PLN activity below asks you to consider and then represent who belongs to your PLN.

### Extend Activity #4
##### Mapping your PLN
> To map your PLN, you will use a tool such as [Google Draw](https://docs.google.com/drawings), [Coggle](https://coggle.it/), [Miro](http://www.miro.com/), a Teams Whiteboard template or even PowerPoint ([see more Visual Organizer Tools in the Extend Toolkit](https://toolkit.ecampusontario.ca/family/visual-organizer/)), to create a visual diagram of the people, organizations, collectives, and others who are in your network. You can even tie in your new connections that you found in the previous activity!
>
> If creating a visual diagram presents a barrier for you, you can map your PLN by creating an audio, video, or written reflection.
