In this module, we focus on online opportunities to collaborate. The Internet distributes connections and ideas more effectively than most of us could have imagined just a few years ago. In fact, the [earliest online communities](http://blog.higherlogic.com/the-well-where-online-community-began) shed light on the promise of how collaborative online spaces could become the focus of rich and vibrant experiences in learning together.

You can create an online space that allows for this exchange within a teaching and learning context in one of two ways: through participating in digital communities for learning that already exist, or by building your own learning network. In the meantime, you can visit the [Extend Toolkit](https://toolkit.ecampusontario.ca/) to learn more about options for online collaboration tools.

A good collaborative community may reflect the guiding principles found within a “community of practice,” which has been defined as a group “of people who share a concern or a passion for something (domain) they do and learn how to do (practice) it better as they interact regularly” (Lave & Wenger, 1998). To better understand the role of communities of practice, read the post from Dr. Tony Bates: [The Role of Communities of Practice in a Digital Age (Tony Bates)](http://www.tonybates.ca/2014/10/01/the-role-of-communities-of-practice-in-a-digital-age/).

Communities of practice generally have three main characteristics:

### Domain

a shared knowledge and skill within a focused area.

### Community

individuals converging and learning together.

### Practice

sharing strategies, tools, resources and examples through a knowledge exchange.

This creates collective intelligence which becomes implicitly held knowledge with each other. ](images/38547088821_54f179c177_o.jpg)

The aim is to broaden your network to include diverse, cross-disciplinary skills and insights, and the online world affords just that. You will find that you can often meet peers and potential collaborators through chance online meetings in discussion groups or by using social networking tools such as Twitter.
