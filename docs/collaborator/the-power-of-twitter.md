Watch the video [Using Twitter Effectively in Education](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqSCR3HU4eg) (Teaching and Learning in Southern Australia, 2013), with Alec Couros who is a professor at the University of Regina. He is a leading thinker about digital skills for educators and the development of PLNs. Couros explains his thinking about Twitter in the video and why you might want to “follow” particular educators or monitor specific hashtags.
