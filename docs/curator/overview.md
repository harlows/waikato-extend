# Overview
You may not know it, but you likely are already a curator.

If you have ever made a playlist in iTunes, or organised a personal library in your house or on a device, or bookmarked your favourite sites on your computer, or subscribed to a feed reader, you are a curator!

This module takes you beyond curating for yourself and your personal interests. It explores ways to curate from your learnersâ€™ perspective to create engaging, interactive, and open course materials. It discusses Creative Commons and Copyright and explores strategies to search for, find, and evaluate Open Education Resources (OER).

## Outcome
Examine the process, value, and the impact of collecting and combining existing resources when creating content.

## Objectives
- Discuss key aspects of Creative Commons.
- Develop or adopt a system for evaluating and sharing learning resources.
- Explore curation tools that align to specific preferences and needs.
