# Scenario <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->
I know that some of my resources need refreshing, but I am not sure what resources are available to help and how I can use them once I find them.

## Objectives
- Discuss key aspects of Creative Commons.
- Develop or adopt a system for evaluating and sharing learning resources.
- Explore curation tools that align to specific preferences and needs.
