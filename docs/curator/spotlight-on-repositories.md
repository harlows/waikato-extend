# Spotlight on Repositories

This section provides just a small sample of the repositories available. These resources here have been assessed and included based the criteria of:

*   Findability
*   Ease of use
*   Comprehensiveness of coverage (inter- and intra-discipline)

It is worth taking the time to explore all those that interest you. It may take a while to identify a few favourites but doing so will save you much time in the future.

## Visual Interest: Slides, Graphics and Photos

![a pie chart, a bar graph and a photo of a stick person](images/38547086981_6c85695c0b_w.jpg)

Most images that you can search for with the standard search engines like Google or Bing are copyrighted; their use is locked down and therefore you cannot legally use them. However, the big engines now include a filter that allows users to search for images based on license. With an additional click or two from the default “image search,” you can source **openly licensed images** to spruce up your course content.

## Images

When searching for images, be sure to look for inclusive and diverse representations. You have an opportunity to show your audience what inclusive workplaces look like. Try options such as [The Gender Spectrum Collection](https://genderphotos.vice.com/).

The [Creative Commons Search](https://search.creativecommons.org/) is a great place to start when looking for images and other media.

[Flickr.com](https://www.flickr.com/) supports Creative Commons. A filter on its site facilitates search results from creators who want to share their work.

[Unsplash.com](https://unsplash.com/) embraces the open world with its clear statement: “All photos published on Unsplash can be used for free. You can use them for commercial and non-commercial purposes. You do not need to ask permission from or provide credit to the photographer or Unsplash, although it is appreciated when possible.”

## Slides

While there are many types of content, most instructors rely on slides to anchor their weekly lessons. The Canadian National Institute for the Blind (CNIB) has recommended [guidelines](https://cnib.ca/sites/default/files/2018-07/CNIB%20Clear%20Print%20Guide.pdf) to make visual communications accessible. The guidelines make recommendations with regards to font size and contrast which are useful in developing slides and other documents that are posted on an LMS. More information can be found on making accessible slides [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=4&v=stcrFyF39IE&feature=emb_logo).

## Learning Objects: Simulations, Games, Texts, Modules

Repositories abound with learning objects, from the smallest (e.g., graph, article) to the largest (e.g., captured lectures, entire courses) shared by colleagues from around the globe. Some offer objects for all disciplines, and others are discipline-specific, often having grown from one department at one institution with a commitment to sharing its knowledge and then allowing it to grow beyond its borders.

When selecting additional resources, keep diversity in mind. Look for resources that show diverse groups in the profession or case studies that use non-Anglophone names. Choose podcasts that showcase diverse voices. Select TED Talks from diverse speakers.

### Extend Activity #2
#### Find Your Fit
>
> This activity gets into the good stuff! You will now have the opportunity to explore the repositories and find course content or information that interests you. When searching for resources look for more than one type of media.  It is a good idea to provide information in different ways – text, audio and video/images – as learners differ in the ways in which they perceive and comprehend information that is presented to them. Check that the resources you have chosen are accessible. For example, videos should have closed captioning and podcasts should have accompanying transcriptions.

Referatories and Repositories
-----------------------------

There are many ways to search for Open Educational Resources. A great place to start your search might be by using a **referatory**. A referatory is a search that simply links out to content hosted elsewhere while repositories host file(s). Referatories may have broader reach, and you may find the same OER in a referatory and a repository. There are two main referatories for finding OER.

**Click on the titles below to find out more about each referatory.**

##### MIT Open Courseware

[https://ocw.mit.edu/educator/](https://ocw.mit.edu/educator/)

Beginning in 2000, MIT has been committed to contributing its courses and accompanying resources online, for free ([CC BY NC SA](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/)). Now with 2,400 courses, educators can browse and borrow material relevant to their own courses. “Instructor insights” by MIT lecturers and professors provide a wonderful value add. The newly implemented filter or search by “instructional approach” is intriguing. Limit your search to activities and courses that promote active learning, model design process, or support reflective practice.

##### Public Domain Review

[https://publicdomainreview.org](https://publicdomainreview.org)

Founded in 2011, it is an online journal and not-for-profit project dedicated to the exploration of curious and compelling works from the history of art, literature, and ideas. The focus is on works which have now fallen into the public domain, that vast commons of out-of-copyright material that everyone is free to enjoy, share, and build upon without restriction.

##### LibreTexts

[https://libretexts.org/](https://libretexts.org/)

Started in 2008 at the University of California Davis, LibreTexts is an online educational resource that has since expanded to 400 texts in 154 courses (as of 2018), making it one of the largest and most visited online educational resources.

NOBA is an open and free online platform that provides a high-quality, flexibly structured psychology resource for instructors and students. Noba has also curated the various modules into a number of “Ready-Made” textbooks that instructors can use as-is or edit to suit their needs.

##### Nursing

[https://www.montgomerycollege.edu/academics/departments/nursing-tpss/nursing-simulation-scenario-library.html](https://www.montgomerycollege.edu/academics/departments/nursing-tpss/nursing-simulation-scenario-library.html)

Montgomery College offers 10 video scenarios depicting difficult, real-world issues in nursing. Accompanying each scenario are documents to support learning and reflection.

##### Business

[https://mitsloan.mit.edu/LearningEdge/simulations/](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/LearningEdge/simulations/)

Simulations from the Sloan School of Business at MIT are complicated at first glance, but highly engaging and rewarding. Here the simulation would likely be a fair chunk of your actual course content and not a smaller, value-added component. Consider how you might run the simulation as an entire class or in smaller groups using different variables.

##### English as a Foreign Language

[http://oedb.org/ilibrarian/50\_essential\_resources\_for\_esl\_students/](http://oedb.org/ilibrarian/50_essential_resources_for_esl_students/)

##### Humanities

[http://justiceharvard.org](http://justiceharvard.org/)

Although many institutions now share their courses, or portions of them, online Harvard’s Justice course with Michael Sandel has grown beyond the regular offerings. His Socratic method coupled with the venue make you feel as if you are experiencing the class alongside Harvard learners. Each lecture has accompanying material that targets either a novice or advanced learner in the area. This is also an example of how you might use a complete course in another context to supplement an area of your course content.

##### Open Culture

[http://www.openculture.com](http://www.openculture.com/)

Open Culture brings together high-quality cultural and educational media for the worldwide lifelong learning community. Its mission is to centralize this content, curate it, and provide access to this high-quality content whenever and wherever users want it.
