# What is Copyright?

Copyright protects the exclusive right of the originator of a work to copy or license the work. However, not all creators want their work restricted. Creative Commons licenses provide a way for creators of copyrighted works to grant some rights to use or adapt their work to the public, while still retaining the copyright to their works. Works released under a Creative Commons license often have no cost which provides learners with a more cost-effective option to access materials.

## What is Creative Commons?

Creative Commons is a nonprofit organization that helps overcome legal obstacles to the sharing of knowledge and creativity to address the world’s pressing challenges. They have developed a series of licenses that help creators retain copyright while allowing others to copy, distribute, and make some uses of their work. They are valid licenses around the world and last as long as applicable copyright lasts (because they are built on copyright).

> Creative Commons (CC) licenses give creators a choice in how they allow others to use their creations, whether text, pictures, songs, or other forms.

Creative Commons and other commitments to openness are gaining momentum in many environments: open access, open data, open source, open pedagogy, etc. In this module we concentrate on how Creative Commons licensing supports open educational resources, more commonly known as OER. We explore how OER, with their ability to be reused and often remixed, can replace high-cost commercial resources in your courses when adopted. Beyond saving your learners money, these OER can boost learning in your courses and increase student retention. With careful curation, you can design and develop courses that include content tailored to your specific learners’ need, modelling your preferred pedagogical approaches and strategies.

The following video explains some of the differences between Copyright and Creative Commons.

## What are Creative Commons Licenses?

The most common way for permissions to be stated is using a Creative Commons license. If you are not familiar with Creative Commons licenses, please take a few minutes to [learn more about them](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons). You may also find this more in-depth self-guided training on [Copyright, Creative Commons, and Fair Use](https://libguides.consortiumlibrary.org/OERtraining) helpful.To find out more about Creative Commons Licenses take a look at the What are Creative Commons Licenses? (University of Guelph Library, 2018) video.

### What do the icons mean?

Each of the six Creative Commons license images are displayed in the image below. This image has been adapted from a blog post by [Dr. Cable Green](https://www.yearofopen.org/article/week-2-how-to-decide-which-open-licenses-to-use-on-your-work-who-is-using-open-licensing-international-examples/), Director of Open Education Creative Commons. Each icon in a license image has a meaning and tells you what you can or cannot do with the piece of work. When you begin searching for OER you will see these images so it's important to know and understand what each means.

The licenses with the most restrictive permissions are at the bottom moving up to the most free, CC0 Public Domain. You'll notice the bottom two aren't considered OER based upon the restrictive properties of those licenses.

#### Licensing under Creative Commons covers:

![Attribution Icon](images/by.png) Attribution: You may use this work as long as you provide credit to the original creator.

![NonCommercial Icon](images/nc.png) Commercial use: You may use this work as long as your primary purpose is not for commercial gains.

![NoDerivatives Icon](images/nd.png) Modifications or Derivatives: You may use this work as long as you do not adapt and distribute a new version.

![ShareAlike Icon](images/sa.png) Sharing: If you adapt this work and share it publicly, you must release the new work under the same open license.

Creative Commons also provides a public domain dedication tool: [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/). While this is not a license, this tool can be used by creators to relinquish all copyrights to their work and allow others to use the work without conditions.

A piece of work that displays a Creative Commons license is not necessarily a fully open resource. ND stands for No Derivatives, meaning the work cannot be modified or remixed. Since the option to revise or remix is a key aspect of an open resource, sources with an ND restriction are not fully open. You are still free to use the work as-is if that works for you and your course!
