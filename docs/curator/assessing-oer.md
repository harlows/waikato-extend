# Assessing OER

Just as you may need to evaluate your choice of textbook to ensure that it meets your teaching and learning needs, you will need to assess Open Educational Resources.

There are several rubrics and checklists to assist your assessment of OER. While some criteria on these checklists are unique to OER (i.e. What license is the resource released under?) others are more general, like “Does this resource meet my course learning objectives?” Try browsing one or more of the following OER assessment Rubrics. Consider what questions you might need to answer before including an OER in your teaching, and which rubric you would be most likely to use in evaluating OER.

## Spotlight on CRAAP

One widely used way to assess online resources is the [CRAAP test](http://libguides.csuchico.edu/c.php?g=414315&p=2822716). First developed by librarians at California State University—Chico, institutions across the globe have adopted it as a framework for evaluating sources. CRAAP refers to Currency, Relevance, Authority, Accuracy and Purpose

**Select each item in the framework to learn more.**

<div class="accordion">

<details>
  <summary>Currency: the timeliness of the information</summary>
  
*   When was the resource published or posted?
*   Has the resource been revised or updated?
*   Does your topic require current information?
*   Are the links functional?
  
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Relevance: the importance of the information for your needs?</summary>
  
*   Does the resource relate to your needs?
*   Who is the intended audience?
*   Is the information in the resource at an appropriate level for your learners?
  
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Authority: the source of the information</summary>

*   Who is the creator?
*   What are the creator’s credentials or organizational affiliations?
*   Are the creators/collaborators contributors qualified to write on the topic?

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Accuracy: the reliability and truthfulness of the information</summary>

*   Is the information supported by evidence?
*   Has the resource been reviewed or refereed?
*   Are there spelling, grammar, or typographical errors?

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Purpose: the reason the information exists</summary>

*   What is the purpose of the information? Is it to inform, teach, sell, entertain or persuade?

### Extend Activity #4
##### Holy CRAAP!
>
> In this activity you will apply the [Assessing Online Resources Using CRAAP](https://h5pstudio.ecampusontario.ca/content/12925) assessment to one resource that you chose for your contribution to the shared [Curation as Creation | Creation as Curation Padlet](https://padlet.com/extend_ecampusontario/nis016u27mla) used in the [Curation Creation activity](https://bank.ecampusontario.ca/activity/curation-creation/).
> The goal of this module is to extend your awareness and appreciation of content curation. We hope that you also recognize it as a viable and vital option for finding resources as you design, develop and revise courses. Armed with knowledge to source and assess open education resources, you now have the tools to take more control over customizing your courses while saving your learners money by using OER.
> **There are 2 parts to this activity.** Visit the [Holy CRAAP!](https://bank.ecampusontario.ca/activity/holy-craap/)activity in the Activity bank for full instructions and the submission link.
